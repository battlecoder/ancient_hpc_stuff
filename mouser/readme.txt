MouSer v0.1	[OnceUponATime] Release
---------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:
----------------------
  Most Handhelds provide a RS232 serial compatible port of some
  sort. I  just happened to find the way of convert my J728 Sync
  cable into a serial port by crossing some signals (adapter idea
  included in this package). Then I hooked up a mouse and found
  that there was no driver. Solution: Just write one ;)

  The "driver" was implemented as a tray-loadable application so
  you can select some options and load it at your will (instead
  of having to reboot to force detection).
  
  THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN TESTED ON A JORNADA 728 DEVICE. IT MAY WORK
  ON HPC PRO 2.11 OR NEWER DEVICES WITH SH3, SH4, MIPS OR ARM
  PROCESSORS BUT THE ONLY TESTED SETUP IS HPC2000 ARM.

USAGE:
----------------------
Just plug-in the mouse and execute my program. Your mouse should be detected.
Some mouse won't be detected since there are more than just one protocol for
mouses. I just implemented the more common one (Microsoft Mouse Protocol).

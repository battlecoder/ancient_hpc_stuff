INTRODUCTION AND USAGE
----------------------
 HPC applications are currently very hard to find. HPC users has been forced to 'trick'
 software designed for PPC to run under their Handhelds. However, these tricks not
 always work as you would like. Some dialogs may appear outside the screen or not fit the
 screen at all.
 WinWatch is a simple application that is loaded in the system tray. Once loaded winwatch
 provides powerful tools that makes possible to browse windows made for PPC screens with
 the press of simple and customizable hotkeys.
 
 Functions:
* DO LANDSCAPE (Default: WIN + H)
   Resizes the window to fill the whole viewable area and puts any item that goes
   beyond the lower part of the area at the right part of the screen.
* WINDOWS SCROLLING (Default: WIN + Up/Down/Left/Right)
   Allows you to scroll a window in your screen, this way you can view windows larger
   than your screen by moving them as you want.

* FIT IN VISIBLE AREA (Default: WIN + F)
   You define a visible area of your screen. This function will move/resize (according what
   you select) every opened window (or Only the Active window if OnlyToActive is selected)
   so no part of any window will be outside the defined area.
   Useful for bringing "out of screen" dialogs into your sight.

* FIT TO CONTENT (FIX) (Default: WIN + X)
   This will try to "scan" the current active window and resize (only resize, don't move)
   components to make them visible. You can also make WinWatch to 'Try the PPC size first'
   selecting this on the main panel. For some single-tabbed forms you may also want to try
   the 'TabCtl PostProcess' option.
  
* MAKE SIZEABLE (BORDER) (Default: WIN + S)
   This Function force the active window to have a sizeable border so you can resize
   the window as you like.

* MANUAL RESIZE (Default: SHIFT + Up/Down/Left/Right)
   Allows you to resize a window using the Arrow Keys.
   
* CENTER WINDOW: (Default: WIN + T)
   Automagically brings the active dialog to the center of the screen.

* HIDE/SHOW TASKBAR: (Default Win + Z)
   Completely Hides/Unhides the taskbar (Start Menu will still be accesible)

* TASKBAR UP/DOWN: (Option In Panel)
   Puts the TaskBar at the upper part of the screen or restores it back to the bottom.
   If Selected (together with "Run at startup") It'll put the taskbar in the upper part of
   the screen at Windows startup.

 You can hide WinWatch by pressing the OK button in the upper-right corner or the "_"
 button. Unloading is accomplished by pressing the "X" Button. Once 'Minimized' in the
 tray, double-tap it and it'll show again. tapping once in the systray icon will display
 a menu for quick-changing options.
  

 WINWATCH WAS MADE FOR THE JORNADA 720 HANDHELD, SO IT REQUIRES ARM (OR MIPS [Untested])
 PROCESSOR. WAS DEVELOPED FOR HPC 2000 BUT ALSO WORK ON NEWER VERSIONS LIKE WM2003.
 HOWEVER, I DON'T GUARANTEE WINWATCH TO WORK ON A PLATFORM OTHER THAN HPC2000 ARM/MIPS.


HOTKEY SETTINGS
----------------------
 Since v2.1 you can specify your own hotkeys for every action.
 For every function you will have to choose TWO keys. One is the HOLD key, and the other
 is the ACTION key.

 The HOLD key is the one you must hold while pressing the Action key in order to execute
 the function.

 The HOLD key however can be ANY key (not only WIN/CONTROL/ALT/SHIFT).
 if a key OTHER THAN WIN/CONTROL/ALT/SHIFT is selected, then the key will act as a 'toggle'
 for this function.
 
 Let's say you selected the Window Scrolling Hotkey to be "A + Arrows".
 Once you press the "A" key (anytime with winwatch running in the background of course)
 you'll be able to scroll the active window using the arrow keys. If you press "A" again or
 use another 'toggled' hotkey you'll disable the "scrolling window mode".
 The current toggle mode (if any) will be displayed in the Systray menu.

 To set a hotkey, press either the HOLD or ACTION button for a given action in the
 HotKeys panel and press the desired Key. Pressing ESC or Clicking the "Clear" button,
 clear the current HotKey.
 
 IF YOU DESIRE SINGLE KEYSTROKE HOTKEYS FOR A GIVEN FUNCTION, SET THE HOLD BUTTON
 TO THE ONE YOU DESIRE AND THE ACTION BUTTON AS "NONE".

## Notes
This repository will be home to the software I developed for WinCE Handheld devices in the early 2000s.
All the projects will hopefully include both binaries and source code, depending on what I'm able to gather from my backups.


Please bear in mind that I wrote this software a long time ago, so there are a few things you should know:
* I wasn't using any kind of source control system, so this is just what I've been able to rescue from **really** old backups.
* If I find more than one version of either source code or binaries, that package will be available in the **_ARCHIVE** folder inside the project.
* I was young, and naive, and inexperienced, so don't expect brilliantly written software, nor anything resembling decent code practices.
* Related: There's not much documentation to begin with, but you will most likely find massive amounts of broken English inside.
* Everything here was developed using **really** old software, like Microsoft's eMbedded VC++ 3.0. Getting a hold of those tools won't be easy.
* Unfortunately I do not have a list of all the required tools, so I cannot help you setup a development environment that'd compile any of this.
* Apparently I was working on a 2.4 version of Winwatch but never released it? Anyway, the source code is there if you want to take a look.

Eons ago I published all of this software on my website http://damnsoft.org/, and I while I've moved to other projects, most of it remains available in http://damnsoft.org/web/software/museum.

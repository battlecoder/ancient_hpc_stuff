<h3>Creating *.OK Layouts</h3><br>

</center>
<font size=2>
Here's the OKey Main dialog. I won't explain it in details since there's nothing
to understand here.<br>
Basically in this screen you can load layouts files (2) and the name of the layout
will appear in (1). Once a layout is loaded, you can enable (3) or disable it (4)
whenever you want. The icon in the systray will appear greyed when disabled.<br>
At your right you have the Options panel. OKey can create a shortcut in the \Windows\Startup
foder so it will run when WindowsCE starts (i.e after a soft reset). Just check the (5)
box and OKey will create the shortcut. Unchecking the box will make OKey to remove it.<br>
Checking (12) will cause that OKey start fully minimized in the system tray.<br>

When OKey is launched it will load the last layout you used if (6) is checked.<br>
OKey layouts are files with the *.ok extension. Usually there shouldn't be any application
associated with these files. Checking the (7) box will associate OKey with these files,
so whenever you open a *.OK file OKey will be launched and the layout will be loaded.<br>
Pressing (10) will show a window with the version number and some info about the development
of OKey.<br>
Pressing (11) will fully minimize Okey into the system tray. When fully minimized, you can
tap ONCE on the systray icon to display a pop-up menu with some options.<br>
That's for basic usage. However, you will probably like to create your own customized layout,
with your own mappings and symbols according to the language you speak.<br>
Pressing (8) will launch the layout Editor:
<p align=center>
<img src=sch.jpg border=0>
</p>
OKey will let you perform two kind of mappings:
<ol>
<li><a href=#one2one>One-to-One mapping</a></li>
<li><a href=#unicode>Unicode Combinations</a></li>
</ol>
Once you have finished with your layout, you'll need to give it a name in the textbox above
the "Save..."(1) Button and press (1) for saving it into a file.
<br>
<p>
<h4><a name=one2one>One-to-One Mapping</a></h4>
The most basic function offered by OKey is a one-to-one mapping (i.e each key will
be translated into another one). "Mapping" <b>A</b> into <b>B</b> will cause that whenever you
press <b>A</b> in your keyboard the system will be tricked to think that you really pressed
<b>B</b>.<br>
The Mapping Table is shown through lists (4) and (6).
Whenever you select a key in the (4) list, the mapped value will be highlighted on the (6)
column. Same goes in the other way.<br>
<b>To remap</b> a key from the list (4) you can either:
<ul>
<li>Press the "New"(3) Button: The button will now read "...". Press the key you want to
map in your keyboard and will be automatically selected from list (4).
<li>Select the key from the (4) list by yourself and press the "->"(5) button.</li>
</ul>
Once done any of either actions, the "->"(5) button will now read "..." indicating that is
waiting for the new value. Press on your keyboard the key you want to be the mapping of
the one you selected in (4).<br>
If your keyboard doesn't have the Key you want to simulate or map you can use
the provided <b>Tool</b> to simulate the keystroke. Select a key from list (13)
and press <b>Simulate Key</b>(2). It has the same effect that the physical press of that
key.

<h4><a name=unicode>Unicode Combinations</a></h4>
<b>UNICODE</b> is a standard that defines a UNIQUE code for EVERY single character of
every single language. WindowsCE handles Unicode for displaying text.<br>
Since <b>UNICODE</b> defines thousands and thousands of characters it has been broken
down into character ranges according to the language they belong. These tables can be
found at <a href=http://www.unicode.org target=_blank>http://www.unicode.org</a>.<br>
Different <b>fonts</b> available for computers implement different character ranges. That's
why some fonts have characters that the other doesn't have. One of the most complete
<b>UNICODE</b> fonts is the <b>MS Arial Unicode</b> which contains 51180 glyphs, a large
subset of the <b>UNICODE</b> standard. The <b>MS Arial Unicode</b> font itself is
about <b>30 MB</b> in size.<br>
In OKey you can create up to 256 Unicode combinations. The limit was stablished due
indexing and memory issues, it may be expanded in future versions of OKey if needed.
You can create key combinations or single keystrokes for generating Unicode characters.<br>
Combinations implemented in the current layout are listed in (8).<br>
In order to create a new combination for a given <b>UNICODE</b> character you'll need to
follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> Select from (12) the <b>Modifiers</b> (Keys to be held) for your combination (if any).</li>
<li> Press the "Press a Key"(7) button. Now the button will read "...".</li>
<li> Press in your keyboard (or use the <b>Simulate Key</b> tool to press) the key you want to use
in combination with the modifiers selected in step 1.</li>
<li> The pressed button will be shown below (7).</li>
<li> Optionally select a font from (11) that you know it contains the character you want. It's just
for properly displaying the character on the preview box.</li>
<li> Search and select from (14) the <b>Unicode</b> character you want to assign to your combination. You
can type the number if you know it or look for the character (may take you a long time if you don't know
where it's most likely to be) by using the arrow keys.</li>
<li> Once the character you want to assign is displayed on the preview box press the "Add" (9) Button to register
the combination.
</ol>
You can delete a combination any time by selecting it from (8) and pressing the "Delete" (10) Button.
